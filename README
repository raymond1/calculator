To run this project, you will need to do the following things:
1)Copy the uncompressed htdocs folder into a web folder
2)From the command line, go into the htdocs folder and type in php bin/chat-server.php
3)Open up a browser and go to localhost/htdocs/index.php(change to an appropriate location on your own computer if necessary)
4)Open up a second browser and go to the same location as above
5)Type in 2 a in the text area, and then click send.
6)Type in 2 b in the text area, then click send. Repeat this for 2 c, 2 d, 2 e. Notice that sometimes the text is sent to one browser, and sometimes to another. What is happening is that a random browser is chosen to store the text that you type in after typing in the 2.

Some other things you may notice:
1)I am using server side events to update the time
2)I am using a background Worker object to count numbers
3)I am using the ws protocol by using a Ratchet server
4)I am used composer to install Ratchet
5)I used JQuery
